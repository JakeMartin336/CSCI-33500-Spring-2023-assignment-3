This is the README for Assignment 3: 
The assignment calls for us to create and modify code that allows the user to provide txt files and for us to create hash tables based upon those files that were provided. The create_and_test_hash.cc file takes a file from a user, reads it line by line and creates a hash table for every line in the file. The user must also provide the specific type of hash table they want, and then based on that, we have to create separate files that create those specific types of hash tables. After this, we count the num of elements in the hash table, the size of the hash table, the collision count when creating the hash table, as well as the average collisions for the hash table.
